quantum_cache - Predictive Multi-Dimensional Caching The Revolutionary Concept: A cache that doesn't just store data - it predicts future access patterns across multiple dimensions and pre-computes results. The Innovation: "Temporal Data Prediction" Traditional Caches: Store what was accessed Quantum Cache: Predicts what WILL BE accessed and pre-computes it rust// It learns your patterns: cache.put("user:123:profile", profile_data); cache.put("user:123:settings", settings_data); // It predicts and pre-computes: // "If they accessed profile, they'll likely need permissions next" let permissions = cache.get_predicted("user:123:permissions")?; // Already computed!
